# The application of three methods (Gradient Forest, Structural equation modeling, and scenario-based nonparametric tests).

##  Gradient Forest
Gradient Forest (GF) model is employed to further to quantify the complex relationships between oceanographic indices and recruitment indices. 

The code is in [Gradient Forest.R].

##  Structural equation modeling
To formalize the hypothesized causal relationships and test the direct/indirect effects, structural equation modeling (SEM) is employed to assess the complex interrelationships 
between the explanatory variables and the two fish recruitment indices. 

The code is in [Structural Equation Modeling.R].

##  Scenario-based nonparametric tests
After detrending the recruitment indices of the two fish species, these indices are compared across different scenarios, 
with the statistical significance of the difference obtained using a Kruskal-Wallis test, followed by a Wilcoxon test.  

The code is in [Nonparametric Tests.R].
